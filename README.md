# Estimate the pointing error of the SAS

This repository is designed to build an automatic pipeline that can improve the estimation of the STIX (https://github.com/i4Ds/STIX-GSW) pointing error.

The automatic pipeline (status as of 21-Jul-2023) includes the following three scripts:

1. `download_STIX-cpd-aux_stixpy.ipynb`: This script automatically downloads cpd and aux data starting from a list of externally provided events in which the flare UID has to be provided.
2. `automatic_STIX_imaging.pro`: This script performs automatic MEM_GE images for all files downloaded automatically in STEP 1. The time range and energy range of the images are taken from the externally provided list.
3. `automatic_STIX-AIA_comparison.ipynb`: This script automatically downloads, does the cutout and reprojects the AIA 1600 maps to the STIX view for all maps generated in STEP 2. At present, the result is a png figure with the STIX map plot on top of the AIA 1600 map.

**We note that all the files generated by this pipeline, including FITS files and PNGs, contain the UID in their filenames. This makes it easier to associate each different file with the flare in the starting list.**
